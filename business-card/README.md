### Make the card
When the user clicks “Submit”, their input should display on the card
* Get the value of each input field
* Add it as HTML to the correct element in the business card template

### Change the color
When the user clicks “Submit”, their input should display on the card
* Get the value of each input field
* Add it as HTML to the correct element in the business card template

### This is an online business card, so let’s add a link to the email element.
* add an anchor tag inside the email element
* when the user submits an email, add an href property with the correct mailto: URL like this example:
```html
<a href="mailto:hi@example.com">
    hi@example.com
</a>
```

### "Extra" points
* How about having the card update when you press enter as well?
* Validation on submit?
* Real time validation?
* Can we have one function for changing colors instead of two?
